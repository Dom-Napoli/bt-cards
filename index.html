        <p>"Starting in the mid-1800s with a cross between the bulldog and the white English terrier, the bull terrier was developed as a gentleman’s companion. Initially bred only as a white dog, and because of his greatcourage and style, he quickly gained popularity and earned the nickname, “White Cavalier.” Near the turn of the century, the colored variety began to develop. Now shown as two separate varieties, they are identical except for color, and can be born in the same litter. Still bred and loved as companions, they are energetic, playful and strong-willed. After an active puppyhood, expect to live with them on the couch."
